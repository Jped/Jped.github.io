  <h4>Computer Architecture </h4>
  <hr>
    <p class="description">This is a class I took spring freshman semester. The class consisted of teaching the basic theory of computers and several hands on projects using logic chips and simplicity studio efm8.
    Pretty interesting stuff. 

      <ol><li>The first project we built was an alu using logic chips, sort of dld</li> <li>The next project was taking that alu and sending a clock signal along with opcodes from the efm8</li><li>The next project was making a stopwatch on the efm8</li><li>The last project was taking the efm8 and having it read the boot splash from the raspberypi through uart and displaying it on the screen</li></ol> </p>
  <h4>Four Questions of Judaism </h4>
  <hr>
  <p class="description"> <a href="http://www.fourquestionsofjudaism.com">Link to the website</a><br> I built this project for a Rabbi of mine from Yeshiva (Yeshivat Maale Adumim). I still maintaint it and such. It is all on google app engine and is written in python. Honestly in hindsite I probably have rathered use a different dev setup, but GAE is what I know the best and is pretty simple</p>
  <h4>Digital Logic Design</h4>
  <hr>
    <p class="description">This is a class I took fall freshman semester. Interesting class. I had three main projects <ol><li>Braile <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlKJjLmURg&feature=youtu.be">Video</a> &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbZ8zstnm_aOrw1outmarTnczlVEIlZr3_CNDNytPr8/edit?usp=sharing">Report</a></li> <li>Traffic Light <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlKJjLmURg&feature=youtu.be">Video</a> &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgUUXeBuYLllv_ZuK4p_HPnxsaCRG5RWInWP9eBzp7s/edit?usp=sharing">Report</a></li><li>Final Project: Whack-a-mole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlKJjLmURg&feature=youtu.be">Video</a> &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/121LBxHrkwU0GlJDc-_fZ8fdPRLzn0fiWxHWk8cJUIHo/edit?usp=sharing">Report</a></li></ol> </p>
  <h4> Flow Bench</h4>
  <hr>
  <p class="description">As part of a freshman engineering design class, I along with a team built a flowbench for the cooper motorsports team. Although the design is not extremly complicated, we did have a lot of issues with flow and getting the right CFM to go through the test piece. Given this, we went through a few designs until we got the most efficent one.
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f12iId7__2p9l4xPWlGY5QYeWO4bZiC782kWgN6jy_Y/edit?usp=sharing">Here is a link to the report</a></p>
  <h4>Pagevamp</h4>
  <hr>
  <p class="description">I worked for <a href="www.pagevamp.com">pagevamp</a> the summer before my Junior and Senior years in highschool. To be quite honest, I have no idea how I landed this internship (I mean I did write <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150320083014/http://blog.pagevamp.com/the-comment-that-changed-it-all">this blogpost</a> about it -- but I am talking figuratively). In any case, they are really good people there. They gave me a chance and gave me a lot of real projects to work on. They gave me the opportunity to gain the tools for me to be where I am today. I worked on their internal marketing tool which consisted of a scraper, mysql database, and a gui. It is written in python. I also had to set up all the servers for the tool, which consisted about 10 workers and 1 master. In addition, I worked on a platform for them to sell bulk website licenses.</p>
  <h4> SleepWell </h4>
  <hr>
  <p class="description">A project for a highschool BioEngineering class. We took a mindflex eeg and modified it to be able to be used with an arduino. The project focused around two things: <ol> <li> reccording sleep waves</li> <li> acting as a smart alarm</li></ol></p> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uXPiy2_HX4MxLFP8mM4GYsXbn2pBeIx54wstIeRziIY/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the report</a> </p>
  <h4> NYTPi </h4>
  <hr>
  <p>This may actually be my first real coding project, and to be quite honest; it is my faviorite. The project was a raspberry pi based. The pi was connected to my printer and everymorning at around 6 or 7 it would grab all articles relating to middle east politics from the NYtimes api and print them out. I ended up using this for about two weeks and then I was paranoid of wasting ink and paper so I stopped it. I am really tempted to put it together again. The code is on my github somehwere I blieve...</p>
