        <p>emotions
<br>
<br>what the heck are they?
<br>
<br>I mean, we go around doing all this shit just because of this unexplainable feeling we have inside of us.
<br>
<br>Take all these pop songs about "love", every god-damn song is about this, what is the big idea? And we fall for this garbage everytime
<br>
<br>The thing that annoys me the most is sometimes I have no idea why I am experiencing a certain emotion, and on top of that sometimes I actually want to
<br>get rid of it but have no idea how to.
<br>
<br>For example, some days I am just angry. Then I take a second, and ask myself: why the heck am I mad? The worst part is that I dont know.
<br>I dont know why I am mad, nothing bad happened that day, but I am just mad.
<br>Sometimes  I will justify it with some hogwash like "oh i am not happy with life". Bullshit.
<br>I am happy with life, life is great, it is full of challenges, it is pretty interesting.
<br>
<br>Another example, I see some random girl and all of a sudden I am in love. I hardly know this person. I have no idea how they are as a character
<br>and what their true personally is, and now I am playing my whole life with them in my head. lol. This too annoys me because I dont know how to stop this.
<br>
<br>
<br>I dont think we are just a bunch of chemicals. I do think most of the time emotions are that, but I think the real power is an analysis of these emotions like this one.
<br>While I cant really control these emotions now, soon enough I will be able to.
