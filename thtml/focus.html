        <p>Focus.<br>I have read in Rav Areyeh Kaplan's book <i>Jewish Meditation</i> that a person's intellectual ability is gauged on how well they can focus in on the task at hand.<br>By focus he means complete focus, a focus where the mind is fully engaged.<br>He goes on to say that we can get to a level where we can get to this state on command.<br>Honestly, I really think that Rav Kaplan is right here. I do not think this is the sole parameter, but it is definetly important.<br><br>Focus has been tough. Especially when it is nonstop.<br>I feel that I am expecting myself to be in the constant grind and focus. Even when I am wasting time, in the back of my head I have that voice telling me that I got<br>to get back on task and focus. Yet, I know somewhat empirically, and from this book I am reading: <i> The power of full engagement </i> that there is a value in taking breaks.<br>Burn out is a real thing, I feel it.<br><br>I think that my real challenge is readjusting the way I do work (this has a lot to do with how I feel guilt, which I will write about soon...). I need to focus smartly.<br><br> A lot of the time I spend doing <i>shit focus</i>. Internally, I call this comfort work. Basically I sit infront of my math textbook looking at a concept sorta half thinking about it<br> while that other half of my brain is sleeping or daydreaming. I wouldn't work on a problem of course-- the smallest amount of those-- because they cause me to actually use my hand.<br><br>I have had some really nice focus spurts. This usually happens when I am really pisssed off. When I am really mad, I put in some headphones crank up the music and just pound. If I<br>am good I  can get 30 minutes high quality shit and then about another 30 minutes falling action. I know I am in this mood when I dont care what music is on. I have so some how exploit<br>this.<br><br>But before I can start working on taking breaks and stuff I need to figure out my guilt issue...<br><br>gnite. <br></p>
