        <h1>What is Truth?</h1>
        <small>2020-03-15</small>

   	<p>
		I used to be obsessed with the Truth.
	</p>
	<p>
		I thought the meaning of life is to attain Truth.
	</p>
	<p>
	While I am not going back on that statement, I do have some qualifying thoughts:
	I do not think Truth is as attainable or apparent as I used to think.
	</p>
	<p>
	In fact, I think the number of things that are "fact" is much less than I used to assume.
	</p>
	<p>
	I do not want to get into the details of what I consider as absolute fact, although that may be necessary at some point, but I would rather keep this conversation a little more casual. 
	</p>
	<p>
	In order to develop this thought, I am going to try to describe the different levels of Truths I think exist.
	</p>
	<p>
	The first and strongest level is math.
	Mathematicians have built a wonderful system for themselves. Using a few agreed upon axioms, they have developed wonderous castles that are built on an impeccable foundation.
	In order for something to be used in this world they have created, it has to be justified. Once justified it has its place and will always have its place in the kingdom of math.
	A mathematical statement that is justified is timeless. It is an absolute Truth within their world (ie axioms and starting principles). Maybe with time it will be played with and made more general, but once a statement has been accepted it is considered Truth.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an observer, I am pretty impressed with their world. It is lit. Yet, not to make an over generalization or anything, but most of the mathematicians I have met in my life are pretty lost in that world. They are happy there, and have no reason to come out. Most of them understand that the real world is not as clean and clear and under control as their world is -- maybe that is why they love that world instead of this one.
	</p>
	<p>
	All fields in science use math, or math like statements as a basis for their exploration.
	</p>
	<p>
The next level of Truth, which in my opinion is not as ultimate as math is physics (and other sciences). My familiarity with physics is much less than with math, but I will continue nonetheless. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Physics is concerned with modeling the physical world we live in with the tools developed in math (or sometimes the mathematical tools they develop to describe our world). Sure there are many statements in physics that can be classified as fact, but a lot of the statements are models of the Truth. Take a very common example, the model of the atom. There have been several different models of an atom starting from the early 20th century. While these models were not completely wrong, they were not absolute. They did not completely describe what an atom is. Today, our model is definitely closer to the Truth, but there are still fundamental principles that we do not fully understand. My main point here is that while we use math to describe these models and we have experiments to back up these mathematical models we create, they are not complete pictures. The nature of the statements in science are completely different than in math. Math is a very sequential/linear build up from principles to bigger and bigger statements. Science is a little more messy. The statements are approaching the Truth, but there is not a clear path of getting there. Personally, I think in many cases they will never get to the Truth. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Sometimes I hear some big people in the field make claims that I really do not understand (and this could be my fault). For example, in his book "The book of why" Dr. Judah Pearl talks about how Pv=nRT is a fact of the world. Isn't the ideal gas law just a model. idk. Also, I have heard Dr. Yann Lecun on a handful of occasions describe that certain principles of physics are time invariant because the equations that model them have no notion of causality (that x causes y to happen), because you can just put in negative time. He uses this as a pseudo argument that causality does not exist in our world. I do not get that either. They are much smarter and more experienced than me, so I will leave this as a lack of my understanding and not a question on them.
	</p>
	<p>
	<p>
	In an effort to keep this short, I am going to jump a few steps and get to the field of science/math which I think is farthest from the Truth: data and statistics.
	</p>
	<p>
	I love data.
	<br>
	I respect statisticians. 
	<br>
	I am sure they are good people.
	</p>
	<p>
	But when people just drop numbers and start saying data this data that I really get annoyed.
	</p>
	<p>
		Data is good, but chill out.
	</p>
	<p>
	I think statistics is usually interpretation and extrapolation under a thin veil of math.
My problem with statistics can be summarized as follows: how do we know we are controlling for every confounder. A confounder is a variable that both influences the thing you are observing and the outcome. For example, if you want to say smoking causes lung cancer, one possible (but since discredited) confounder could be a gene that causes people to have craving for nicotine and makes them more susceptible to smoking. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Statistical studies should be used as it is the best tool we have currently, but we have to keep in mind that it is not taking into account everything, because that is not possible. We are not God. We can get closed with randomized control studies or some form of causal analysis, but sometimes we are not even able to do that. With that being said, when we see a study that draws a correlation between two things, we need to look into the study and think deeply if there are confounders that can be taking place. If there are then we need to ask ourselves another question: do the benefits of following the conclusion of this statistical study even though we are not sure outweigh the potential risk.

	<p>
	I realize that someone can read this and claim that I am anti-science.
	<br>
	<br>
	First things first, call me anti-science I think that is pretty funny. 
	<br>
	<br>
	I always wanted to be counter-culture anyhow.
	<br>
	<br>
	Second, if you think this is anti-science then I think you know nothing about science and that you are trying to politicize something that is not meant to be politicized.
	<br>
	<br>
	Science is the closest thing we have to the pursuit of Truth. All I am claiming is that it is much more dynamic than I used to think.
