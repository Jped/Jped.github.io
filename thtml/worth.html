        <p>One of my favorite tweets of mine is: <br>		"I am not the next Mark Zuckerberg; I am the first Jonathan Pedoeem" <br>I tweeted this on July 7th 2015, about 3 and a half years ago. The internal struggle that ultimately lead to me tweeting this <br>is something that I am still dealing with today. Honestly, I would venture to say that today, it is much stronger than what it<br>was back then.<br><br><br><br>The question that I am struggling with is: "Do I have what it takes to be who I want to be?" <br><br><br>It is known that I want to be an entrepreneur. I have dreamed to build a tech empire since I was early in high school.<br>To be honest, I was very embarrassed about talking about early on because of the fear that I would never be able to achieve this goal<br>and then I would seem like some failure that just talks himself up and is never able to produce. <br><br><br>But, this is my dream. I want to start a company that will leave a footprint in the tech world and help progress the internet for its<br>users. I want to build a company that will have an affect both internally and externally. I want my team to feel like there work is <br>meaningful, I want them also to realize that there is more to life then just work. Externally, I want people to use the product we build<br>to help them have more seamless and peaceful lives.<br><br>There are a few reasons why I do not want to work for a company. First, I can not handle the the bureaucracy. There is so much bull shit when <br>it comes to being part of an established system. There is some whack notion of "order" or "this is how things are done". Who says those ways are the <br>most efficient? Also, established systems are hella slow. People who know me, know I like to move real quick. Second, I think I can really make an impact<br>on both the industry and my team. Third, I can not see myself having a desk job for the rest of my life. There is more to life. I want to be able to work<br>very hard early in my life and then be able to take it slower as I grow older. I want to be with my family, and I want to be able to spend time thinking about <br>life. This leads to my fourth and last reason for wanting to start a startup, I want to eventually open a coffee shop. I want to facilitate a place for people <br>to come and take a break from the stresses of life. I want people to talk with one another, listen to each other's problems and discuss their differences.<br><br><br>Now these are the reasons why I want to start a company, but I am constantly plagued with doubt in myself. In high school it was very easy for me to be confident in myself.<br>I went to small school, sure there were a lot of smart people in my class, but we were all able to excel. I looked at all the tech giants and they did not seem to far off from me.<br>Starting at the Cooper Union, after taking a gap year in Israel, really caught me off guard.<br><br>I did not want to go to the Cooper Union, honestly, I was a bit demotivated from the fact that I did not get into any school of my choice (I only got into University of Maryland as a Senior in HS, I applied to Cooper in my gap year). Freshman year at Cooper was really hard. Professors were really nasty, they were always calling people stupid and implying that you did not deserve to be there. They always talked about how Cooper is a shell of what it used to be when it used to be free.<br><br><br>Most students bought that. They did not believe that they belonged. They thought they were lucky to get accepted and that really they do not deserve to be in this school.<br>I resisted, and am still resisting. Not that I think I am better than my peers; people here are much smarter than they think, but because if I believe that I am not good, then I feel that I have given up on my dream.<br><br><br><br>I often read stories about early life at the big startups, and listen to podcasts with tech giants. They excite me, they motivate me to keep on dreaming, but they also make me question my capabilities. <br>Recently, I read <a href="https://triplebyte.com/blog/interview-with-gmail-creator-and-y-combinator-partner-paul-buchheit">this interview </a> with Paul Buchheit, employee 23 at Google. with Paul Buchheit, employee 23 at Google. He recounts stories from the early days at Google, he talks about how Craig Silverstein, the first employee at google was able to code so fast that his "screen would flicker and code will appear". He also mentions that the first time he figured out he was good at coding was when he placed 2nd in the ACM programming competition.<br><br>I also read <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/12/10/the-friendship-that-made-google-huge">this new yorker piece</a> about Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemaway and how they pair programmed much of googles original code base.<br><br>The other day I was listening to Reid Hoffman's podcast "Masters of Scale", in this piece he was interviewing Marissa Meyer, the first female employee at Google. She talks about how she had 12 job offers in her inbox when she was graduating Stanford.<br><br><br>Meanwhile, I look at myself. What do I have to show. I have no internship to show for this summer, I was able to get to the interviews at google, but it is not clear if I will proceed. I have been told my code is dirty and inefficient. At ACM, my team was able to get 9th place but that was because we had the best coder at Cooper on our team.<br><br>Look I do not think I am stupid. That would be pretty offensive and arrogant to say that. Nor am I looking for someone to pat me on the back and tell me I am a bright kid. I am just trying to express that it is hard for me to believe that I can make it. Idk. I still believe that these people are not as good as I paint them to be. I do not think I am that far off.<br>Sure some of them may be better coders that me, but I think I have a lot of other traits to offer. Anyhow, I feel like once I believe that they are in a different planet than I am I will give up all hope achieving something on the level they have.<br><br><br>All in all, this is a humbling experience, I have a lot of work to do, which is good. I cant have everything solved at 21 ;) about Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemaway and how they pair programmed much of googles original code base.<br><br>The other day I was listening to Reid Hoffman's podcast "Masters of Scale", in this piece he was interviewing Marissa Meyer, the first female employee at Google.
