        <h1>Research Experience</h1>
        <h4 class="titles">Yolo-Lite at UNCW REU</h4>
        <div class="description">
          Selected for NSF funded Research Experience for Undergraduates in Data Mining at University of North Carolina Wilmington. While there I learned many different
          data mining and machine learning techniques. A bunch of the projects I did can be seen <a href="https://github.com/Jped/RCodes">on my github here</a>. My main research project was in Deep Learning.
          Rachel Huang and I set out to develop a fast object detection algorithm that would be able to run on a computer with out a GPU. We used darknet to train a architecture based off of the YOLO algorithm.
          We were able to achieve about 10fps on the web and 20fps on a computer with about 30% mAP on pascal VOC.
          Our project demo can be seen <a href="https://reu2018dl.github.io/"> here </a>, and a write up can be found here.

        <h4 class="titles">Radar Project</h4>
        <div class="description">As part of the fall sophomore Electrical Engineering Projects class, I built a coffee can radar. We followed MIT's documented coffee can radar that can be found <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/resources/res-ll-003-build-a-small-radar-system-capable-of-sensing-range-doppler-and-synthetic-aperture-radar-imaging-january-iap-2011/">here</a>. I continued this project as an independent study in the spring. I developed the code to combine both the range and velocity modes to work from the chirp signal. I also helped update the circutry to allow for more freedom of input functions to the vco. </div>

        <h4 class="titles">Port Authority Research</h4>
        <div class="description">
          Summer of 2017 (and continued on to the following academic year), I worked under Professor Shlayan of Cooper Union. I was given cellphone data collected from select gates at the Port Authority Bus terminal, and worked in order to build a queuing model for movement of people in the station. While we were not able to get a good fit on the data, it was a really great experience jumping into BIG DATA (exciting!). Most of the work was done in python, while at the end we used some R.

        <div class="description"> I started <a href="https://themorningmunch.com/"> The Morning Munch</a> along with Shlomo Benyaminov the summer after freshman year (2017). The Morning Munch is a content aggregator where users can come in, either on the website or app, select feeds that they find relevant to them and get the feeds either to the app, website, or email</div>
        <h4 class="titles">Four Questions of Judaism </h4>
        <div class="description"> <a href="http://www.fourquestionsofjudaism.com">Link to the website</a><br> I built this project for a Rabbi of mine from Yeshiva (Yeshivat Maale Adumim). I still maintaint it and such. It is all on google app engine and is written in python. Honestly in hindsite I probably have rathered use a different dev setup, but GAE is what I know the best and is pretty simple</div>

          <h4 class="titles">Computer Architecture </h4>
            <div class="description">This is a class I took spring freshman semester. The class consisted of teaching the basic theory of computers and several hands on projects using logic chips and simplicity studio efm8.
            Pretty interesting stuff.
              <ol><li>The first project we built was an alu using logic chips, sort of dld</li> <li>The next project was taking that alu and sending a clock signal along with opcodes from the efm8</li><li>The next project was making a stopwatch on the efm8</li><li>The last project was taking the efm8 and having it read the boot splash from the raspberypi through uart and displaying it on the screen</li></ol> </div>

          <h4 class="titles">Digital Logic Design</h4>
            <div class="description">This is a class I took fall freshman semester. Interesting class. I had three main projects <ol><li>Braile <a> href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlKJjLmURg&feature=youtu.be">Video</a> &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MbZ8zstnm_aOrw1outmarTnczlVEIlZr3_CNDNytPr8/edit?usp=sharing">Report</a></li> <li>Traffic Light <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlKJjLmURg&feature=youtu.be">Video</a> &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lgUUXeBuYLllv_ZuK4p_HPnxsaCRG5RWInWP9eBzp7s/edit?usp=sharing">Report</a></li><li>Final Project: Whack-a-mole <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=btlKJjLmURg&feature=youtu.be">Video</a> &nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/121LBxHrkwU0GlJDc-_fZ8fdPRLzn0fiWxHWk8cJUIHo/edit?usp=sharing">Report</a></li></ol> </div>
          <h4 class="titles"> Flow Bench</h4>
          <div class="description">As part of a freshman engineering design class, I along with a team built a flowbench for the cooper motorsports team. Although the design is not extremly complicated, we did have a lot of issues with flow and getting the right CFM to go through the test piece. Given this, we went through a few designs until we got the most efficent one.

          <div class="description">
            As part of the first DSA course at the Cooper Union, I learned about stacks, queues, linked lists, hash tables, trees, and other datastructure types.
            I have two projects (<a href="https://github.com/Jped/DSAProject1">first<a>, <a href="https://github.com/Jped/DSAProject2">second</a>) that I had to submit as part of the course</div>

          <div class="description">
            In the NLP course I took at the Cooper Union, we focused on the 2nd edition of Speech and Language Processing by Jurafsky and Martin.
            The two projects I built for this class can be found:
            <a href="https://github.com/Jped/NLPProject1">Project 1</a>

          <div class="description">A project for a highschool BioEngineering class. We took a mindflex eeg and modified it to be able to be used with an arduino. The project focused around two things: <ol> <li> reccording sleep waves</li> <li> acting as a smart alarm</li></ol> <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uXPiy2_HX4MxLFP8mM4GYsXbn2pBeIx54wstIeRziIY/edit?usp=sharing">Here is the report</a> </div>
          <h4 class="titles"> NYTPi </h4>
          <div class="description">This may actually be my first real coding project, and to be quite honest; it is my faviorite. The project was a raspberry pi based. The pi was connected to my printer and everymorning at around 6 or 7 it would grab all articles relating to middle east politics from the NYtimes api and print them out. I ended up using this for about two weeks and then I was paranoid of wasting ink and paper so I stopped it. I am really tempted to put it together again. The code is on my github somehwere I believe...</div>

          <h1>Work Experience</h1>
          <h4 class="titles">Mentor at RKYHS STEM summer camp </h4>
          <h4 class="titles">Pagevamp</h4>
          <div class="description">I worked for <a href="www.pagevamp.com">pagevamp</a> the summer before my Junior and Senior years in highschool. To be quite honest, I have no idea how I landed this internship (I mean I did write <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150320083014/http://blog.pagevamp.com/the-comment-that-changed-it-all">this blogpost</a> about it -- but I am talking figuratively). In any case, they are really good people there. They gave me a chance and gave me a lot of real projects to work on. They gave me the opportunity to gain the tools for me to be where I am today. I worked on their internal marketing tool which consisted of a scraper, mysql database, and a gui. It is written in python. I also had to set up all the servers for the tool, which consisted about 10 workers and 1 master. In addition, I worked on a platform for them to sell bulk website licenses.</div>
