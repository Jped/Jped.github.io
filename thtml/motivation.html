        <p>It is clear to me why I have difficult self-motivating myself:<br>There is too little structure.<br>While I am in school I have the structure that I am used too and the one I excel at: having many different tasks to do for other people and getting to interact with many people.<br>While I am at work I have structure that I do not like that much, but I am able to tolerate: having one task to do for other people.<br><br>When I am alone, there is no set structure, partly because I have not consiously set one up, but now that I am becoming more attuned to my strengths, I think it is clear to me that I need to set up a structure where I may myself busy with several different tasks and also set up interactions with other people.<br>As much as I would love to be able to sit down and work on one project for 8 hours, I think my max is about 4 hours right now. However, if I can come up with two different tasks that are either tangentially related or not related at all, I think I can get away with two 4 hour blocks. <br><br>Additionally, I think trying to fit some correspondance with someone else into the mix will really help me succeed.  <br><br></p>
