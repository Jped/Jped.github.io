        <p>I once heard one of my Rabbis, Rabbi Chamudot, comment that "a man has to know when to stop". He said this somewhat quietly, when he decided to<br>send us out of class early.<br><br>Its funny how this was such a small comment, but it has been in my head for a while recently.<br><br>The importance of taking a step back, or leaving space is vital.<br><br>Today specifically, I was working on a computer architecture project with my good friend and roommate. We are having this issue where we cant<br>successfully import a library. It such a stupid issue that should not exist, yet we have spent a good four hours on it...<br>Given that the atmosphere was pretty tense. He wants to try one thing, I want to try another and we butt heads.<br><br>The fatigue just makes it worse.<br>Honestly, I held myself pretty well, but I should have called it off at least an hour or so earlier... after a certain point there is no real progress, just arguments...<br></p>
