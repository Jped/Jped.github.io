        <p>Conquering Sleep<br><br><br>It is obvious that sleep is vital for a successful day, but I am not positive that I completely buy the whole 7 hours for a successful day business.<br>I will tell you that the whole first semester of college I got about 7 hours of sleep every night, but I was always tired. Yet in the second semester<br>I got about 6.5 hours on average and was not as tired.<br>Sure, I did not exercise much, and it was the winter, but another big difference was that I was very conscious about the amount of hours I had.<br>If I did not get the 7 hours, I would tell myself that I was tired and that I need a nap even though I do not think I really needed it.<br>I think that really affected how I felt<br><br><br>Another vital part of sleep that I have still not mastered is waking up.<br>How I wake up reveals how good my discipline is.<br>My older brother once made the point that waking up is the first interaction you have with your desires. If you let your desires<br>and laziness to win, you snooze the alarm clock and go back to bed. If you win you jump right out of bed and get on with your day.<br></p>
