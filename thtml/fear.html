        <p>Speech is a wonderful creation. The power to discuss is one of the distinctive features of humans. However, speech alone is not enough, there are the untalkable, the ineffable feelings where simple speech does no justice.<br>These feelings haunt us, they are on the tip of our tongues they are in the back of our minds, they are with us in the silence. At most times they are just a mush of a thought in our brains. We know they exist, we feel them, but we hardly ever put them into words, we do not know or rather want to know exactly what they are saying. We fear to put them in words, maybe we do not want to go through the challenge of putting them into words because we think words won't do justice, or more likely because we do not want to face them head to head. They are the daemons within us.<br>But we can not have them hide in the closet forever. They slow us down. They hold us back, they keep us at bay.<br>We must persevere and take them out, we must fight them till the break of dawn. They will injure us, they will hurt us, but there is more damage in not fighting with them. <br></p>
