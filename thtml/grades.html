        <p>I titled this thought as grades, but I do not think that is accurate. This is not only about grades, this is about jealousy.<br><br>The question: Should I compare myself to other people? Is jealousy a good thing?<br>Prelim: Are jealousy and comparing yourself the same thing? To be honest, I dont think at their core they need to be the same thing. Yet,<br>in reality, I find it hard to seperate them. When I look at other people and I say that wow he got this grade, and she focuses soo well, I am<br>not making a simple observation. I know that deep down there is a little part of me that is asking: "why am i not like that?"<br><br><br>I have thought a lot about this recently, and I am still not sure what I make of it.<br><br>I do not think anyone will straight up admit that jealousy is good; I do think that there is a certain social stigma that makes that word<br>sound like a bad one (afterall it is one of the ten commandments). However, I do feel that I (and most people), do maintain a certain level of the envy. But, what is wrong with it?<br>Honestly, I it pushes me to work harder. This I know to be true.<br>Recently I heard a certain person got a certain grade on a fairly important test. Now, I did average on this test, a little above average.<br>Also, I have made it my goal not to ask people for their grades (while I really want to know),but when I heard this person got that grade,<br>I couldnt help but catch myself thinking: "damn, what the hell am I doing". Because of this, I was motivated to study hard that night for the<br>next test, which doesnt seem like a bad thing...<br><br>Yet, I do see the bad in this. It takes over my goals and focus. Instead of focusing my goals and doing what I want to do, I have to prove my<br>self worth by beating someone else. This usually leads me to go off path.<br>In an ideal world I will only focus onmyself. I will focus on doing the best I can and getting where I need to be.<br>I Jonathan Pedoeem have to do x and do y to get to z.<br>Who cares what they think of me or how well they are doing.<br>I need to do what I need to do.<br>Recently a friend of mine who isnt relgious anymore, reminded me of a line from perkei avot  it goes something like "if i am not for myself than who is for me"<br>I do feel that it is easier said than done though, it is easy for me say something like this, but when it comes down to it how will I implement it.<br></p>
