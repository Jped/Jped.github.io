        <p>Hope is a fascinating thing.<br>Without it there is no drive. Why should I push hard if there is no vision of something bigger and better in the future?<br>Yet at a certain point there is a questing of the hope. Maybe the hope is na√Øve maybe it does not lead to anything.<br>Tame Imapla has this song "feels like we only go backwards." The song is as the name suggests, and is the feeling I am currently feeling.<br><br>On paper, I have lots of hope. On paper, I have lots of aspirations. On paper I know what I need to do, and what I need to improve.<br>But in real life, every time I feel like I have crossed off one of those tasks, I realize that I really have not finished any of the previous task.<br>Maybe this is due to my initial naivety, maybe I assumed solving the initial task was simple, or maybe I improved at that moment, just to fall back into my<br>old habits.<br><br>It is hard to push forward when it is not clear which direction you are moving in. Was the past Jonathan Pedoeem better than the current one? Maybe in some ways,<br>but he sure as hell was not better overall. The past Jonathan has not gone through all the experiences current Jonathan has gone through.<br><br>So whats the deal. What do I do? How do I proceed?<br>Maybe I expect to much out of myself too quickly. I am willing to accept that. But giving up completely seems like throwing in the hat too early. I need to just keep on<br>iterating and moving forward. I will trust that there will be improvement and that I will move forward, otherwise things are a little too grim.<br>  <br></p>
