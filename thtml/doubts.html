        <p>Doubts.<br><br>Personal doubt is something I feel often. Its a tense feeling, sort of like a fence around the chest.<br>It hurts, and it weighs me down.<br><br>I am trying to think objectively here, is there any use to it?<br><br>It just makes me feel like shit.<br><br>Honestly, I think the key is to just keep pushing. Pick a path and just go. Move quickly.<br><br>If it turns out to be a bad move, re-correct, dont waver to much to think too much.<br><br>Yet, I feel this is easier said than done.<br></p>
