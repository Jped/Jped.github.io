        <p>While in high school, I really thought I was a doer. I thought that was my qualifying trait. I do not think I am<br>idealising my high school career. I know this for two reasons. <ol><li>I remember in my stanford application they asked me for a few words that described me, I wrote doer</li><li>I tried making a personal website a few year back and my title line was something like "Jonathan Pedoem. Doer. Thinker. ..."</li></ol><br><br>Now, I do not know if I have changed. I do not know if I have become worse. I do feel that I am not in that position anymore, I feel as if I lost some of my <i> mojo </i>.<br>However, this can be due to a change of enviorment or something like that. or it can actually be true.<br><br>Yet, I do not think it matters that much. I just know now that I can be a better doer. I have this image in my head of what I want to achieve. I want to be able to go around<br>and put my mind on something and do it.<br>I know this is a huge thing that will be difficult, so I am patient. Recently, I have come more attuned to this patience thing. Patience, while simple on paper, is tough.<br><br>This thought it kinds of scary too. Recently (namly after last semester), I have become more fearful. I am scared to do things. Kinda sucks, but then again I know what I got to do<br>I just go to keep focused and stay patient till I get where I want to go.<br><br>I dont think doing is only an innate trait. I believe it is a muscle that starts breaking exponently once you stop using it.<br>To be a doer you go to do and do and do with no questions or excuses asked. Once there is a break in the doing you are done.<br>There is not easy way. Just got to do, starting today, starting now (ie with writing this).<br><br>Ight gnight <br></p>
