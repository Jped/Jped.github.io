        <p> So today was my last day for the my first year at cooper.<br><br> What can I say?<br><br> For one, the second semester was much much better than the first.<br> The first semester was the worst experience I have had thus far in my life. No question about it.<br><br> Am I happy?<br> I dont know. I think I am closser than complacent than I am happy. I do not know if this is what I<br> want to do with my life, but at this point I do not really know of anything else, and ee is a pretty good<br> degree so i'll stick with it.<br><br><br> My roomate, Yigal, told me I should list everything I learned this year, but to see how i learned so much...<br> So here it goes<br><br> MATH<br><ul><br><li>I Took Calc 1 again and I realized that I did not know it at all. Mintchev is crazy. If you think you know calc after high school think again</li><br><li>Baby lin alg was pretty cool, it kinda helped me understand numbers in a different way</li><br><li>Calc 2 was actually fun, very practical and times and interesting at others. Helped me expand my understanding of math. </li><br><ul><br><br> SCIENCE<br><ul><br><li>Chemistry was tight, although the class was not that challenging. Chem lab on the other hand was a complete waste of my time</li><br><li>Physics is hilarious. Wolf is a true character with a huge ego. LOL. In any case it was a fun class, got to get into some challenging problems.</li><br><ul<br><br><br> HSS<br> <ul><br> <li>HSS1 was actually a great experience, wrote a good bit and started developing analysis skills</li><br> <li>HSS2 was more of a joke... still had some good discussions in class though.</li><br> </ul><br><br>ENGINEERING CLASSES<br><ul><br><li>DLD- digital logic design. This class has caused me tons of stress, but learned a lot about the basic logic of computers.</li><br><li>Computer Arch, next level DLD, lots of hands on practice.</li><br><li>EID motorsports, great fun working on building a flowbench for the motorsports team</li><br><li>Drafting class, pretty annoying to be honest....cooper loves these 1 credit classes that take a ton of time</li><br><li>Programming languages, didnt learn much programming which didnt bother me because I already know how to code a good bit. Learned a lot about the nature of computers though</li><br></ul><br><br><br><br>When I say these classes are fun, that doesnt really mean much. I think I would find almost any class in any subject fun...<br></p>
