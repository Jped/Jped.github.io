        <h1>Who won the argument?</h1>

	Communication is a powerful tool that sets humans apart from other animals. With communication comes the ability to disagree and to discuss.
	</p>
	<p>
	I have always held such conversations in high esteem (as long as they are civil), believing a good discussion is a great way to develop a bridge with someone else.
	</p>
	<p>
	I still believe in this. Communication, specifically when used to get through our differences, is the only way for us to close the gaps between individuals. It is a great path to empathy.
	</p>
	<p>
	Yet, I have found that often arguments are not the be all and end all when it comes to understanding an issue.
	</p>
	<p>
	A while back there was the court case (supreme actually) Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission. The case was brought against a baker who refused to make a custom cake for a gay wedding. There was a lot of noise with this case and I remember hearing arguments for both sides.
	</p>
	<p>
	Someone got on NPR and made an analogy in support of the customers that I thought was compelling. It was something along the lines of comparing this situation to segregation or denying services to someone based on their religion. Just as we did not and do not stand for such behavior anymore, this baker should not be able to deny services.
	</p>
	<p>
	Later, I heard another compelling analogy from Ben Shapiro. He compared this situation to a former speechwriter for President Obama being asked to write a speech for President Trump. He argued that just as we would not force the Obama speechwriter to write a  speech for the Don we should not force this baker to bake the cake.
	</p>
	<p>
	Both analogies seemed legitimate and convincing to me, and if I did not hear both I would have had only one of them in my mind.
	</p>
	<p>
	After realizing this, I remember thinking to myself (and telling Guy) that analogies are hocus pocus. In any situation, you can cook up some analogy that sounds compelling and fits your argument.
	</p>
	<p>
	Lately, I have broadened this realization to the following: A compelling argument is in my opinion more correlated with the skills of the arguer than the actual contents of the argument.
	</p>
	<p>
	Maybe this is pretty obvious, but I think arguing is a skill in its own right and some people are just good at it.
	</p>
	<p>
	Just because someone may corner you with their argument does not mean that they have "won" (I know this sounds like a huge cop out and it can be in certain contexts). I am not saying that this is always the case, sometimes it is important for me to understand that I am wrong. This is something that is difficult, but is important for my self improvement.
	</p>
	<p>
	Often I find that in most arguments the people arguing are trying to win rather than trying to hear the other side. In a forum where there are spectators, this makes a lot of sense as each side has something to sell. However, if an argument is between two people this accomplishes nothing.
	</p>
	<p>
	<i>So Where do I think arguments break down?</i>
	</p>
	<p>
	I think this relates with my last post -- it has to do with the fact that these discussions are really non-linear (maybe even non-continuous). I can not tell you how many times I have been mid argument and lost where I was in my own logic (LOL maybe it is cause I am a shit arguer). While holding an argument it is very difficult to take sequential steps when there are a lot of other emotions going on, and that is why I think it is really a skill to do it well.
	</p>
	<p>
	<i> Am I anti-arguing? </i>
	</p>
	<p>
	No.
	<br>
	<br>
	I just think that we need to remind and realign ourselves to focus on uncovering the situation instead of just being right. I am definitely not there yet, and I think it requires a good sprinkle of humility. We also need to be able to understand that compelling arguments should be taken in, but they need to be seriously digested. We need to do our due diligence ourselves, just because someone is eloquent does not mean jack.
	</p>

	Recently I finished Principles By Ray Dalio. In that book Dalio talks about how at Bridgewater he has implemented what he calls an "idea meritocaracy".
	</p>
	<p>
	Basically the premise is that we are all biased and are lost in our own sauce (which I agree with). His solution for this is to build an "algorithmic" system where everyone is encouraged to argue with each other to get to the "truth" of an issue. The meritocracy part is that arguments should be based on their merit, not on who said it. The system he describes does take into consideration your "believability" and "responsibility", which is something he has a whole formula to calculate. 
	</p>
	<p>
	I am kinda impressed with this system. I have not seen it in action so I can not really comment if it suffers from the whole discussion above, where arguments are more about winning than getting to the bottom of an issue. In any case, I think a system like this is probably better than some hierarchical system where you have to follow your higher ups because they are "higher" up.
